# Mithril Polymer Examples

The purpose of this project is to show that it's possible to make web
apps with this two excelent frameworks: [Mithril](https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js "Mithril's repository")
and [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer "Polymer's repository").

If you don't know, Mithril is a JavaScript MVC framework which have a
[very simple API](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/mithril.html), have a
small size (only 5kb minified and gziped!) and is [very fast](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril/benchmarks.html)!
And the Polymer is a Google project that makes Web Components works on
today's browsers.

## Why don't just use one of them?

Well, you can build any app using only Mithril or Polymer. But I like
to think of Mithril as a vertical framework and Polymer as horizontal one.
I think that with Mithril, you would put every logic associated with
your problem's domain and with Polymer, you would put every view or presentation
logic.

And my purpose with this work is to show how Mithril is flexible and
easy to use with others frameworks and libraries. Sure you could use Polymer
with other framework, like Angular. But Mithril is so simple to use and
easy to learn how it works that you can integrate it with anything
without any effort! And I will show you how to do this, at least, with
Polymer.

## What examples this project will show?

Here is the list of examples made with Mithril and Polymer until now
(this will grow with time):
